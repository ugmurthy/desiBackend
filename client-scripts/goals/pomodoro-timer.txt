**Prompt for a Coding Agent:**

You are an expert front-end web developer specializing in clean, modern, vanilla JavaScript applications. Your task is to create a complete, self-contained, single-page Pomodoro timer as one HTML file with all CSS embedded in a `<style>` tag and all JavaScript embedded in a `<script>` tag. No external files, frameworks, or libraries are allowed (except optionally linking to Google Fonts for typography and a free public sound file URL for audio if needed).

### Core Requirements
- **Pomodoro Logic**:
  - Default sessions: Pomodoro = 25 minutes, Short Break = 5 minutes, Long Break = 15 minutes.
  - Track completed Pomodoros; after every 4 Pomodoros, automatically switch to Long Break.
  - After a timer ends, automatically start the next appropriate session (Pomodoro → Short Break, Short Break → Pomodoro, etc.).
  - Display current mode (e.g., "Pomodoro", "Short Break", "Long Break") clearly using Icons (No text)

- **UI/UX Features**:
  - Modern, stylish design: Use a dark or gradient background, glassmorphism/neomorphism effects, smooth transitions/animations, clean sans-serif typography (import a Google Font like "Inter" or "Poppins" if desired).
  - Circular progress ring (using SVG stroke-dasharray/offset or CSS conic-gradient) that visually fills as the timer progresses.
  - Centered circular timer display with large MM:SS countdown in the middle of progress ring
  - ICONs for selecting mode (Pomodoro / Short Break / Long Break), Start/Pause (toggle), and Reset. : Chose appropriate icons
  - Display current session count (e.g., "Session 1/4").
  - Responsive layout that works well on desktop and mobile.
  - Subtle hover effects, button animations, and a satisfying "complete" visual change when a timer ends.
  - the form factor should be equivalent to a mobile phone.
- **Audio Feedback**:
  - Play a clear, pleasant notification sound (bell/chime) when the timer reaches 00:00.
  - Prefer a simple JavaScript-generated beep using the Web Audio API (AudioContext oscillator) to keep everything self-contained. If using an external sound, link to a free public URL (e.g., from freesound.org) via an `<audio>` element.

- **Additional Nice-to-Haves** (include if they fit naturally):
  - Change the page title to show remaining time (e.g., "12:34 - Pomodoro").
  - Visual feedback when switching modes (color changes: e.g., gree for Pomodoro, blue for breaks).
  - Prevent page refresh from losing state (optional, but bonus if simple).

### Output Instructions
- Output ONLY the complete HTML code.
- Wrap everything in proper `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags with `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
- Add comments in the code to separate sections (HTML, CSS, JS) for clarity.
- Ensure the timer starts in Pomodoro mode on page load.
- The final file must be copy-paste ready: write it to `pomodoro-index.html` 

and open pomodoro-index.html using bash tool
